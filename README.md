# spawn-zk-snarks

`spawn-zk-snarks` is a Rust library that provides a simple implementation of Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs). The library allows developers to generate and verify proofs using SHA-256 hash functions and random witnesses. It is designed to be a basic building block for projects that require privacy-preserving cryptographic proofs.

## Features

- Generate proving and verification keys
- Create verifiable proofs for given witnesses
- Verify proofs with the generated verification keys
- Random witness generation
- SHA-256 based hashing for proof validation
